## Welcome to team-14's github

In this reposetory you will find all the informations about our projekt.

## The Challenge:
How can municipalities, through digital solutions, motivate local companies towards climate protection, in times of crisis?

## Our Solution:
As a solution to the Challenge we decided to extend the existing website of the city of munich and add a couple of new features. These features include ranking businesses that participated in the ECOprofit challenge based on their reduction of CO2 emissions.
For more detailed information about our solution and our design process please visit our wiki page.
